# Security Policy

## Cultural Content Protection

This Hawaiian cultural learning platform handles sacred and sensitive cultural knowledge that requires special protection. We implement multiple layers of security to respect cultural protocols and protect community members.

## Cultural Security Measures

### Sacred Content Protection
- All sacred content is marked with `is_sacred: true` in the database
- Access requires appropriate cultural level AND role verification
- Elders and verified kumu have review authority over sacred material
- Content undergoes cultural approval workflow before publication

### Permission System
- Database-level Row Level Security (RLS) enforces access controls
- Cultural levels: Beginner → Familiar → Practiced → Advanced → Kumu → Kāpuna
- Roles: Student → Teacher → Cultural Practitioner → Elder → Administrator
- Multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations

### Data Security
- Environment variables protect all API keys and database credentials
- Supabase handles authentication and encrypted data storage
- No sensitive cultural content stored in Git repository
- Audio/media files use secure cloud storage with access controls
